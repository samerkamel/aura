# Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Core Employee Management

Goal: To set up the initial Laravel project with the Vuexy template and build the core module for creating, viewing, updating, and managing complete employee profiles, including termination workflows.
- Story 1.1: As an Admin, I want to create a new employee profile by entering all their personal information, contact details, position, and base salary, so that they are registered in the system.
- Story 1.2: As an Admin, I want to add and manage bank account information for an employee to ensure they can be paid correctly.
- Story 1.3: As an Admin, I want to upload documents to an employee's profile (e.g., passport, contract) and set optional expiration dates, so I can track document validity.
- Story 1.4: As an Admin, I want to view a list of all employees and search/filter them to easily find specific profiles.
- Story 1.5: As an Admin, I want to edit any aspect of an employee's profile to keep their information up-to-date.
- Story 1.6: As an Admin, I want to view a history of salary changes for an employee to maintain a clear record of their compensation over time.
- Story 1.7: As an Admin, I want to initiate a termination or resignation workflow for an employee, which shows me their assigned assets for clearance and calculates their final pay up to their last day.
